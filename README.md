## Error Handling :
This API implements custom error handling using an AppError class and custom error messages. When an error occurs, it is wrapped in an AppError instance, allowing for consistent error formatting and handling throughout the application. All types of errors, whether they originate from client-side, server-side, or mongoose (database) errors are handled.
Error handling is categorized into two modes :
### Development Mode :
Detailed error messages are provided in JSON format. These messages aim to assist developers in diagnosing and resolving issues efficiently. Example of a detailed error response:
```sh
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "errors": {
      "content": {
        "name": "ValidatorError",
        "message": "the content is required",
        "properties": {
          "message": "the content is required",
          "type": "required",
          "path": "content"
        },
        "kind": "required",
        "path": "content"
      }
    },
    "_message": "Notes validation failed",
    "statusCode": 500,
    "status": "error",
    "name": "ValidationError",
    "message": "Notes validation failed: content: the content is required"
  },
  "message": "Notes validation failed: content: the content is required",
  "stack": "ValidationError: Notes validation failed: content: the content is required\n..."
}

```
### Production Mode :
Error responses are designed to be user-friendly and less detailed to ensure a better user experience. Example of a simplified error response:
```sh
{
  "status": "fail",
  "message": "Invalid input data. the content is required"
}
```
